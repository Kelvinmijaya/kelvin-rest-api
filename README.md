Rule of Clean Architecture by Uncle Bob

- Independent of Frameworks. The architecture does not depend on the existence
  of some library of feature laden software. This allows you to use such
  frameworks as tools, rather than having to cram your system into their limited
  constraints.
- Testable. The business rules can be tested without the UI, Database, Web
  Server, or any other external element.
- Independent of UI. The UI can change easily, without changing the rest of the
  system. A Web UI could be replaced with a console UI, for example, without
  changing the business rules.
- Independent of Database. You can swap out Oracle or SQL Server, for Mongo,
  BigTable, CouchDB, or something else. Your business rules are not bound to the
  database.
- Independent of any external agency. In fact your business rules simply donâ€™t
  know anything at all about the outside world.
